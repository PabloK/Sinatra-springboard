Sinatra-springboard
===================

This application is an attempt at creating a basic stating point for app development of full-stack applications. It will try to generalize as much as possible but in specifics will cater to my personal development needs. I will try to keep the springboard as easy as possible to install but requirements are going to include ruby, rubygems and bundler.


Installation
============
git clone https://github.com/PabloK/Sinatra-springboard.git
cd Sinatra-springboard
bundle install

Running the server
==================
rackup

Rake commands
=============
